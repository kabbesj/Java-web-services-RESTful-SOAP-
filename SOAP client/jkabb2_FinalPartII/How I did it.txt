I ran the wsimport –p client –keep http://www.webservicex.net/FinanceService.asmx?wsdl

I then imported client.FinanceService and client.FinanceServiceSoap

I then added this to the main function:

FinanceService service = new FinanceService();
	
FinanceServiceSoap port = service.getFinanceServiceSoap();

I used port.loanMonthlyPayment(amount,interest,months); to run the function

I requested user input for the variables for amount, interest and months

I converted those into doubles and input those into loanMonthlyPayment 

I then output the amount to the console
